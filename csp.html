    <h1>Child Safety Policy for nostrlabs.io</h1>

    <h2>Commitment to Child Safety</h2>
    <p>nostrlabs.io is dedicated to ensuring a safe and secure environment for all users of nostrlabs.io, with a
        particular focus on protecting children from child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) and child sexual abuse
        material (CSAM). We strictly prohibit any content or behavior that sexually exploits, abuses, or endangers
        children, including but not limited to grooming, sextortion, trafficking, or sharing CSAM. Our policies align
        with global norms, including the Tech Coalition’s best practices for combating online CSEA, and comply with all
        applicable laws, such as the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the EU General Data
        Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CSAE (Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation)</strong>: Any content or behavior that sexually exploits,
            abuses, or endangers children, including grooming, sextortion, or trafficking for sexual purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material)</strong>: Illegal material depicting child sexual abuse,
            prohibited under our Terms of Service and Google Play policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Published Standards Against CSAE</h2>
    <p>We maintain a zero-tolerance policy for CSAE and CSAM. Our standards include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prohibited Content</strong>: Users are strictly prohibited from creating, uploading, or sharing
            content that exploits or endangers children, including CSAM or material promoting predatory behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>User Conduct</strong>: Any behavior targeting children inappropriately, such as grooming or
            soliciting explicit content, is banned.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement</strong>: Upon detection or report of CSAM or CSAE, we take immediate action, including
            content removal, account termination, and reporting to authorities like the National Center for Missing &
            Exploited Children (NCMEC) as required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring and Moderation</strong>: We employ a combination of automated systems and human
            moderation to detect and prevent CSAE and CSAM, ensuring compliance with our policies and legal obligations.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>In.App Feedback Mechanism</h2>
    <p>To facilitate user reports of CSAE, CSAM, or other safety concerns, nostrlabs.io provides an in-app feedback
        mechanism accessible without leaving the app. Users can:</p>

        <li>Receive confirmation of their report and updates on actions taken, where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This mechanism is certified in the Google Play Console as part of our compliance with the Child Safety Standards
        policy.</p>

        published standards and relevant laws. Actions include:</p>
